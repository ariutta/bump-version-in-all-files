# sample-package-2.3.0
Sample description goes here. The production latest release is v2.3.0. (Oops, did you notice that? It looks as if someone forget to update a version number there, because it should be v2.3.0. The test should still find it.)

We are working on the next major version in v3.0.0-rc.3, and the previous major version is available as 1.5.7.
